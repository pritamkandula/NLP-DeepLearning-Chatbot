# NLP-DeepLearning-Chatbot
This is a chatbot built using fundamental concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning. This is a casual talk Chatbot.
NLP concepts like tokenization, stemming and bag of words are used and are necessary for training the chatbot with sentences. Tokenization creates the tokens of sentences by splitting every element/words of the sentences. Stemming operation involves of cutting off the postfix letters of the words to get a base word.
Bag of words contains all the words in an array format consisting of ones and zeroes based on the existence of the word in a group of words.
A neural nerwork of 3 layers with 2 hidden layers is built to train the model.
